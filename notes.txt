#logic for the charging animation from our stock setup:
#
#after post-fs triggers are processed, and before queue_builtin_action( "property_service_init" ),
#init binary checks for "/proc/last_kmsg" and "/proc/first_bootmsg". if neither of those exist, it
#launches "/sbin/chargerlogo" with argv[0] = "chargerlogo"
#
# This scrpit tries to emulate that without hacking up init.c

if [ ! -f /proc/last_kmsg ] && [ ! -f /proc/first_bootmsg ]
then
    /sbin/chargerlogo
