This is a work-in-progress for porting cm7 to run on the LG VM696 phone.
- Current status -

* I'm booting it up with a stock(ish) kernel and ramdisk.  I haven't tried to boot the boot.img created by this build system.
* It boots and runs pretty snappy
* phone calls work (havent tested 911)
* sound
* all the hardware buttons and touchscreen
* sensor library

Stuff that isnt working-
* sdcard & microSD
* wifi
* data (text messages and 3g)
* the hardware buttons dont light up when you press them
* gps
